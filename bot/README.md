# Bot Project

This bot, [@obscuregenre](https://twitter.com/obscuregenre), is meant to make fun of the ridiculous genres sometimes found on [Bandcamp.com](http://bandcamp.com/) pages. It uses a network of genres, as well as prefixes and suffixes generally attached to genres, to generate hypothetical obscure genres (and some not-obscure genres!) It can currently has 351966 different output possibilities.

The bot is hosted at [Cheap Bots Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com), so the code is a [Tracery](http://www.tracery.io/) grammar.
