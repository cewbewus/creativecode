# Rotational Torus Clock

Here's a little clock I made with p5.js! Here's [the javascript file](torusclock.js), and here's a [presentation-ready version](https://editor.p5js.org/cewbewus/present/i2MtD78si).

The inner torus counts milliseconds, the second counts seconds, the third counts minutes, and the fourth counts hours. 

In addition to the toruses (tori? torus?) spinning with the time, the light which illuminates them also rotates with the hour -- illuminating the rings in a 24 hour cycle in a similar manner as the sun does to the earth.

I felt as though displaying these concepts in a three dimensional space, containing one another, would be an interesting way to show the way that time passes not only through our culture, but also through physical space.
