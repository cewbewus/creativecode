# The Jest of the System / by David Botster Wallace

For this novel -- I used the combined texts of David Foster Wallace's already abstract novels *The Broom of the System* and *Infinite Jest* and ran them through the Tensorflow recurrant neural network, and then through a markov chaining script (Markovify). I'm interested a couple of things about the output: first, how computers interpret texts as large and abstract as these examples of postmodern literature; and second, how this work interacts with copyright laws, as it is totally indiscipherable from the original text – not even using the same coprus.

I've uploaded a sample of the text generated, and a link to the source code (which is in Google Colab, as the RNN is only accessible via that.)
