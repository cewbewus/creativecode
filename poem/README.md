# HOWL & MARGARITA

This python script pulls text from *The Master & Margarita* by Mikhail Bulgakov and inserts it into the syntax of Allen Ginsberg's "Howl." The script is not fully complete, but gets through the majority of the first stanza, this is because my hands stopped working since I was manually entering all of the parts of speech tags.
