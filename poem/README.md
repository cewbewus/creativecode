# HOWL & MARGARITA

This python script pulls text from *The Master & Margarita* by Mikhail Bulgakov and inserts it into the syntax of Allen Ginsberg's "Howl." The script is not fully complete, but gets through the majority of the first stanza, this is because my hands stopped working since I was manually entering all of the parts of speech tags. 

It can also be used to rearrange the words while maintaining syntax from a single text, but I felt like it was more interesting to hear an author's words imposed upon anothers syntax. 

I feel as though the philosophically interesting aspect of this project is seeing how one of the most well known poems' syntax retains its value as the words inhabiting its structure are rearranged or replaced with others of the same nature. By doing so we can maybe start to understand what *poetry* is, structurally... 

The script outputs text which seems poetic in nature, despite not usually making very much sense (though "Howl" unaltered does not make total sense at all times itself.) In being poetic, I would allege that it does in fact output *poetry* however forced it may sound.
